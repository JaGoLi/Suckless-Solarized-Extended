# Suckless-Solarized-Extended
My build of various suckless utilities, themed with the solarized theme, and extended with patches.


These builds were made on a ThinkPad X200, future releases will make changes to increase functionality over a wider range of devices by default.

## INSTALL
By default the utilites contain the proper X11 directories for an arch-based system. 
After cloning, simply `sudo make install` to install the already-compiled code on your system.
